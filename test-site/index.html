    <p><strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of               recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following         these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of         people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and        hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations,       limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these.     These guidelines address accessibility of web content on    desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also       often make your Web content more usable to users in      general.</p>
